            Bootstrap is a paradox “in which an object or information can exist without ever being created.”
            It occurs when an object or part of the information sent back in time becomes trapped within an endless
            cause-effect loop in which the object or part of the information no longer has an observable point of
            origin,
            and is said to be uncaused or self-originated. It means that somehow an object, person, or information gets
            stuck in an endless time loop where there is no origin and no end. </p>
        <h2> Example of Bootstrap paradox </h2>
        <p class="para">
            Imagine you are a person who is fascinated by space and physics. Your favorite scientist is Albert Einstein.
            Imagine that you have studied the theory of relativity and you are very much impressed by it. You build a
            time
            machine and go back in time to have a chat with Albert Einstein about the theory of relativity. You take the
            theory of relativity papers and books along with you. But you go back a little too much in time which means
            that
            you go back in time when the theory of relativity wasn't published at all. You ask Albert Einstein about the
            theory of relativity and he tells you that he doesn't know anything about it. You give him the theory of
            relativity books and papers. Einstein studies them and publishes those under his name. You return to the
            present. Nothing has been changed. The theory of relativity is still there in present. But one question does
            arise. Who formed the theory of relativity? You can't say it is Einstein because Einstein studied it from
            you.
            You can't say that you formed the theory of relativity because you studied it from the books which were
            published by Einstein. Then where did it originate from? It seems that the theory of relativity simply
            existed
            and it was self-created. </p>

            We have always believed that time moves linearly. First past occurs, then present, and the future. Our past
            actions
            result in the present and our past and present actions result in the future. But sometimes when a person
            goes
            back in time and creates the bootstrap paradox something strange happens. </p>
        <p class="para">
            In that situation, the future actions affect the past actions. Now wait here is the catch... <br>
            1) Past actions result in future actions. This means first past will occur and then future will occur <br>
            2) Due to the bootstrap paradox, future actions result in past actions ... and those past actions result in
            that
            very future. This means that the future has occurred before the past and that same past is resulting in that
            very future. <br><br>
            This implies that the future is at the origin and the end and that's what we call a loop! Hence Bootstrap
            paradox is a time loop with no origin and no end. </p>

        <h2>What is the solution to Bootstrap paradox?</h2>
        <p class="para">
            The only solution to the bootstrap paradox is metaverse. If a person travels in time in the other universe,
            then
            any change in the past would affect the other universe and hence his universe would not be affected by the
            altering of an event in past. </p>
